# Minesweeper-Game

PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are presented with a field of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. 
If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. 
If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. 
Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs. 
A squareâ€™s "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. 
Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.
If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open. 
This can cause a large area to automatically open.
